Dex is an automated liquidity protocol powered by a constant product formula and implemented in a system of non-upgradeable smart contracts on the Klaytn blockchain. It obviates the need for trusted intermediaries, prioritizing decentralization, censorship resistance, and security. Dex is open-source software licensed under the GPL.

This document provides detailed specification for the Dex smart contracts, discusses security concerns, and offers the general information about the project needed to better understand its nature.
